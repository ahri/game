A list of things this game will not have:

Closed source elements
Distribution of leveling-up points to skills every damn time I level up
Collect X, take it to Z. Get bored at point Y and never play again
Eating/sleeping/gyming/BORING_STUPID_REAL_LIFE_SHIT
A static storyline
3D
Configured systems
Auto-leveled opponents


Stuff the game might have:

Windows/Mac/Linux/Android support
Built off an existing open source game engine (http://orx-project.org ?)
    http://www.scirra.com is interesting but not open (enough), and Windows only
Replayability
Roguelike death frequency (may reconsider)
Easy to quit/continue_later
Minecraft-like auto-saving (consequences matter)
Reputation system that's not retarded
